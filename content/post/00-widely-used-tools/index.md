Web developers are using different tools for web developing. Web development can be divided into `frontend` and `backend`. `Frontend` is the part that that users interact with, or what you see in the browser while `backend` is more related to data processing, data storage and so on. We will focus on `frontend` in this semester and learn backend in the next semester (Spring 2022).

## Frontend Development

For `frontend` development, some tools are important:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org): NodeJS enables developers run javascript outside the browser
- [NPM](https://nodejs.org): NPM is the package manager for NodeJS, it will be installed with NodeJS by default
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com): **[Optional]** Yarn is another package manager like NPM and it seems better that NPM

**Notice**: it is **not** recommanded to install the _latest_ version of nodejs and npm. Please choose the latest `LTS(Long Term Support)` version (currently `v14.18.0`) instead of the latest one (currently `v16.10.0`).

### NodeJS Version Manager (Optional)

Since `nodejs` is developing rapidly, many projects are created with nodejs with low version (like `v12.x.x` or even `v8.x.x`) and some packages will crash in the latest version. `NVM (Node Version Manager)` can solve this problem.

This is optional for the tutorial because we will use the latest version (should be `v14`).

You can find nvm in [Github](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Project Management

For project management, [git](https://git-scm.com) is an important and super useful tool for version control and collaborating with each other.

Before creating a real world project, you should install `git` and learn how to use it.

Recommanded tutorials are:
- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/): it is recommanded to finish section `Introduction Sequence` and `Ramping Up`.
- [Doc from Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/doc): (the author have not read this before).

It is also recommanded to [create a Github account](https://github.com/signup) for practicing git!
